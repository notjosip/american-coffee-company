                <h2>American Coffee Company</h2>
                <p>So at The American Coffee Company, we’ve made it our business to help tell that story. The whole story. And that, in turn, is how we tell ours. Like many great American brands, we began in a garage with not much more than a leap of faith — and our father. His passion for the art and science that transformed those little green beans into the nuanced roasts we still offer is what inspires everything we do, every day, at our ever innovating roasting facility. But our story doesn’t end there. After all, if you’re traveling the globe to source only the finest and most responsibly grown coffee, it’s no longer just your story. It’s that farmer’s story. And his family’s story. It’s a story about our relationship and responsibility to their passion for caffeinated excellence. It’s also a story about how those people on the other side of the planet are helping to change the story in our city.</p>
                <p>Here, with each grind and every pour, in the conversations we have and the discussions we lead, we’re refining the grit of a great city into the ideas that are redefining what it means to be an even greater community. So whether you’re sipping from your favorite mug at home or savoring that last drop at one of our bars, know you’re part of our story. Because at The American Coffee Company, it’s not just about what you’re drinking: It’s about the journey to your cup… And where we’ll go from there.</p>
                <p>At The American Coffee Company, we roast all our coffees to order on custom-modified drum roasters with precise temperature controls and measurements. As a true micro-roaster, one of our strengths is our attention to detail and our ability to adjust to the needs and demands of our customers; a generally educated and awesome group of people.</p>
                <p>Some beans can take the fiery flames of a dark roast and still maintain their complexity. For others, we do a lighter roast so to protect the beans’ floral character and sweetness. Still others are agnostic to roast and will develop splendidly at any color. Every batch is meticulously monitored for temperature during the roast, analyzed for color after, and logged so we can go back and continually adapt our processes.</p>
                <p>We love what we do, so we do it with passion, and we continually strive for excellence. Since we’re into coffee in its many forms, we offer a constantly changing palette, a smorgasbord really, of single-origins, blends, and roast levels. We think they’re pretty good, but that’s a subjective thing – so we invite you to join the ongoing conversation about taste and what defines a truly great coffee.</p>
